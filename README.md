## [1. Spaceship Titanic Classification Prediction](https://github.com/teolj96/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Spaceship%20Titanic%20(GridSearch%2C%20Pipeline%2C%20LogReg%2C%20XGB%2C%20SVM%2C%20NN%2C%20RandomForest%2C).ipynb)

## About
The Spacehip Titanic dataset is a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/spaceship-titanic/data) competition dataset based on the famous original Titanic dataset, this time set in future. The goal of the project was explore which features influence the most a persons ability to get transported and create the best possible model which could predict that. 

## Methods used
* Exploratory data analysis
* Data cleaning
* Feature engineering
* Using pipelines
* Model building and optimization

## Key Findings
Through data exploration and data visualization I found out that:

  * Being from planet Europa

  * Being in Cryosleep

  * Traveling to Trappist or Cancri

  * Being of younger age

  * Being richer/spending more

Gives a person better chance of being transported on the spaceship.

## Some key graphs

Graph 1: There is a higher change to be transported if you are from planet Europa

Graph 2: Travelling to TRAPPIST or Cancri gives you higher change to be transported

## Model results

| Model         | Accuracy          
| ------------- |-------------|
| Logistic Regression      | 0.7779|
| Random Forest            | **0.8033**      |
| SVM                      | 0.7612
| XGB Classifier           | **0.8039**      |
| ANN                      | 0.8016

I was able to get very similiar score of around 80%, the best being XGB Classifier by a small margain. I was not able to go much more than 80% with optimization. The only thing that might have helped was reducing the number of total features in the final dataset.

## [2. Wine Quality Classification Prediction](https://github.com/teolj96/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Wine%20Classification%20(StandardScaler%2C%20ImbalancedLearn%2C%20SMOTE%2C%20XGB).ipynb)
In this project I used a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset) dataset to create a classification model that could classify wine by their unique features and qualities. The dataset is relatively small and has been already cleaned before as it has no null values. I made the mistake at the beginning by cleaning outliers but it proved to be a mistake later because the dataset was so imbalanced as is presented with the pie chart in the file, but I kept the original code inside the file for future reference. The problem with cleaning the outliers is that some of the outlier were located within the smaller categories. Reducing the smaller categories even more made oversampling impossible.

I used several models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN and XGB Classifier. In the end the Random Forest Classifier proved to be the most successful with an accuracy score of 0,86. The next best model was the XGB Classifier with an accuracy score of 0,84. The KNN model with only 1 neighbour showed a good accuracy score but such model would have a high bias and would not be very realistic, thus it isn't of use to us.

## [3. XGB Regressor Time Series Project](https://github.com/teolj96/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Store%20sales%20time%20series%20(Data%20Cleaning%2C%20Groupby%2C%20EDA%2C%20XGBoost).ipynb)
In this project I analysed the Store Sales [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/store-sales-time-series-forecasting) competition dataset. It consists of several datasets such as: train, test, oil, holidays, stores and oil prices. The goal of the project was to analyse and extract various information and create a Machine Learning model that could predict store sales. Through EDA I was able to conclude that the peak sales by average happen in December, a big part of the sales are generated by stores number 40-50, that weekends are a prefered time to buy, that Ouito is the city with the highest sales numbers aswell as the state of Pinchincha. Using that information the store brand owner can adapt its business policy to either focus more on that area or maybe start asking questions about the lack of business in other areas.

In the project I went through data cleaning with Pandas, getting rid of null values and outliers, gathering various information with Matplotlib and Seaborn about the sales, and created a XGBRegressor model with score of 0,94 and the RMSE of 277.40.
