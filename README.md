## [1. XGB Regressor Time Series Project](https://github.com/teolj96/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Store%20sales%20time%20series%20(Data%20Cleaning%2C%20Groupby%2C%20EDA%2C%20XGBoost).ipynb)
In this project I analysed the Store Sales [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/store-sales-time-series-forecasting) competition dataset. It consists of several datasets such as: train, test, oil, holidays, stores and oil prices. The goal of the project was to analyse and extract various information and create a Machine Learning model that could predict store sales.

In the project I went through data cleaning with Pandas, getting rid of null values and outliers, gathering various information with Matplotlib and Seaborn about the sales, and created a XGBRegressor model with score of 0,94 and the RMSE of 277.40.
